CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a web page written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout, design, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual appearance of a web page.

              Key Concepts:
              Selectors: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles. Common types include:
              
              Element selectors: p, h1, div, etc.
              Class selectors: .class-name
              ID selectors: #id-name
              Attribute selectors: [type="text"]
              Properties and Values: CSS defines rules using properties and values.
              
              Example: color: red; (Here, color is the property, and red is the value.)
              Cascading and Specificity:
              
              Styles can be applied in a hierarchical manner, where rules are overridden based on their specificity or order.
              Inline styles > Internal CSS > External CSS
              More specific selectors (e.g., .header p) override less specific ones (e.g., p).
              Box Model: Every element in CSS is treated as a box consisting of:
              
              Content: The actual content of the box (text, images, etc.)
              Padding: Space between content and the border.
              Border: Surrounds the padding (if set).
              Margin: Space outside the border.
              Positioning: CSS offers different ways to position elements:
              
              Static: Default, elements flow normally.
              Relative: Positioned relative to its normal position.
              Absolute: Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
              Fixed: Positioned relative to the viewport.
              Sticky: Sticks to the screen once you scroll past it.
              Flexbox and Grid: Layout systems in CSS for more flexible and complex designs:
              
              Flexbox: A one-dimensional layout system for arranging items in rows or columns.
              CSS Grid: A two-dimensional layout system for placing elements in rows and columns.
              Media Queries: Used to make a website responsive by applying different styles depending on device characteristics (like screen size or resolution).
              
              Animations and Transitions: CSS allows the creation of animations and smooth transitions between different states (e.g., hover effects).
              
              Fonts and Text Styles: CSS provides a variety of text-related properties, including font-family, font-size, line-height, and text-align.
              
              Color and Backgrounds: CSS allows for specifying colors using names, hex codes, RGB, RGBA, HSL, and HSLA. Backgrounds can also include images, gradients, and patterns.
