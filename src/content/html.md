# What is HTML?

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language. It is the foundation of web development. If you're building a website, HTML is where you start. It’s the language that gives structure to a webpage, allowing browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to display content in a readable and user-friendly way.

We can consider HTML to be the skeleton of a webpage. Just like how bones give the body structure, HTML provides the framework for everything you see on the web. It organizes content such as text, images, links, and multimedia into a format that browsers can understand.

## Key Concepts in HTML

### 1. Tags and Elements

All content is made up of tags. Tags act like labels that define different parts of the content. For example:

- `<h1>` creates a large heading.
- `<p>` creates a paragraph of text.
- `<img>` is used to display an image.

Each tag has an opening tag (`<p>`) and a closing tag (`</p>`) to define the start and end of an element. Together, the tags and the content they enclose form an element.

### 2. Structure

HTML organizes content into a hierarchical structure and reads from top to bottom, allowing the browser to display it properly. The basic structure of any HTML document includes:

- `<head>`: Where you put information about the page and links to external resources (such as CSS for styling).
- `<body>`: This is where the content that appears on the webpage goes—headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

Here’s a basic example of HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful image">
  </body>
</html>
```

- `<html>`: This tag encloses everything on the page.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata (such as the page’s title).
- `<body>`: Displays the visible content of the page.

### 3. Hyperlinks

HTML also enables you to link one page to another. This is where the "HyperText" part of HTML comes in. Hyperlinks (`<a>`) allow users to click and navigate to other pages. For example:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example.com</a>
```

### 4. Media and Multimedia

HTML can also embed images, audio, and videos directly into a page:

- `<img>` for images.
- `<audio>` for audio files.
- `<video>` for video content.

This helps create rich, interactive websites.

## Why HTML is the Foundation of Web Development

When building a website, HTML is your starting point. It's like laying the bricks of a house before adding the paint or furniture. HTML gives the page its structure, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds the design and JavaScript adds interactivity. Together, these three technologies form the backbone of web development:

- **HTML** creates the structure.
- **CSS** styles the appearance.
- **JavaScript** adds dynamic, interactive behavior.

Without HTML, web browsers would have no way to interpret or display content, making it essential for creating any kind of website. Whether you're working on a simple blog or a complex web application, everything begins with HTML.

## Conclusion

HTML is the building block of the web. It provides the foundation for all websites by organizing content into a structure that browsers can interpret. Once you understand HTML, you can start to add design with CSS and make your site interactive with JavaScript. Together, these skills form the core of web development, but HTML is always where it starts.
