HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the building blocks of a webpage, including text, images, links, forms, and multimedia elements. HTML is not a programming language but a markup language that uses tags to annotate content for display in web browsers.

Key Features of HTML:
Structure: HTML provides the structure for webpages, allowing elements like headers, paragraphs, lists, tables, and more.

Tags and Elements: HTML uses tags enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <p>, <div>) to define elements. Most tags come in pairs with opening (<tag>) and closing (</tag>) tags, though some are self-closing (e.g., <img />).

Attributes: Tags can include attributes to provide additional information about an element, such as id, class, src, href, and more.

Multimedia Support: HTML integrates images, videos, and audio using tags like <img>, <video>, and <audio>.

Hyperlinks: HTML is the backbone of the "HyperText" concept, allowing users to navigate between webpages via links.

Document Structure: HTML organizes content into a hierarchical structure using tags like <html>, <head>, and <body>:

Interactivity and Styling: While HTML provides structure, interactivity is added through JavaScript, and design is handled by CSS.

Advantages of HTML:
Easy to learn and use.
Cross-platform compatibility.
Provides a foundation for web development.
Supported by all modern web browsers.
HTML is fundamental for building websites, serving as the foundation for web development alongside CSS and JavaScript.
